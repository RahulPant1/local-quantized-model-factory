"What is machine learning?","Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns."
"How does deep learning work?","Deep learning uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to model and understand complex patterns in data. Each layer learns increasingly abstract features, allowing the system to recognize complex relationships and make sophisticated predictions."
"Explain reinforcement learning.","Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by taking actions in an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The agent aims to maximize cumulative rewards over time."
"What are neural networks?","Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information by passing weighted signals between layers, learning to recognize patterns through training."
"What is natural language processing?","Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of AI that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning to process text and speech data."
"How does computer vision work?","Computer vision uses algorithms and neural networks to extract meaningful information from visual inputs like images and videos. It involves tasks such as object detection, image recognition, and scene understanding."
"What is the difference between AI and ML?","AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the broader field focused on creating intelligent machines, while ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data without explicit programming."
"Explain supervised learning.","Supervised learning is a machine learning approach where algorithms learn from labeled training data. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on example input-output pairs, then makes predictions on new, unseen data."
"What is unsupervised learning?","Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in data without labeled examples. Common techniques include clustering (grouping similar data points) and dimensionality reduction (finding important features)."
"How do you evaluate machine learning models?","ML models are evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification, or RMSE and MAE for regression. Cross-validation and holdout test sets help assess generalization performance."
"What is overfitting in machine learning?","Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including noise and irrelevant patterns. This results in poor performance on new data because the model doesn't generalize well beyond the training set."
"Explain gradient descent.","Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize loss functions in machine learning. It iteratively adjusts model parameters in the direction that most reduces the error, like rolling a ball downhill to find the lowest point."
"What are hyperparameters?","Hyperparameters are configuration settings that control the learning process of machine learning algorithms. Examples include learning rate, batch size, and number of hidden layers. They're set before training begins."
"How does backpropagation work?","Backpropagation is the algorithm used to train neural networks. It calculates gradients by propagating errors backward through the network, from output to input, to determine how much each weight contributed to the total error."
"What is a convolutional neural network?","A CNN is a deep learning architecture particularly effective for image processing. It uses convolutional layers with filters to detect local features, pooling layers to reduce dimensionality, and fully connected layers for classification."
"Explain recurrent neural networks.","RNNs are neural networks designed for sequential data. They have memory that allows information to persist across time steps, making them suitable for tasks like language modeling, time series prediction, and speech recognition."
"What is transfer learning?","Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained model and adapting it for a new, related task. This approach leverages knowledge gained from one domain to improve learning in another, often with less data and training time."
"How do you handle missing data?","Missing data can be handled through removal (if minimal), imputation (filling with mean, median, or predicted values), or using algorithms that can work with missing values directly. The choice depends on the data pattern and amount missing."
"What is feature engineering?","Feature engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating new features from raw data to improve model performance. It involves domain knowledge to transform data into a format that better represents the underlying problem."
"Explain cross-validation.","Cross-validation is a technique to assess model performance by dividing data into multiple folds, training on some folds and validating on others. This provides a more robust estimate of how the model will perform on unseen data."
