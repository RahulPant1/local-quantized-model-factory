{"instruction": "Summarize the main points of this text", "input": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun's heat and raising temperatures.", "output": "Climate change involves long-term temperature and weather shifts. While some changes are natural, human activities since the 1800s, especially burning fossil fuels, have been the primary cause. Fossil fuel combustion creates greenhouse gases that trap heat around Earth, causing global temperature rise."}

{"instruction": "Explain a complex concept using an analogy", "input": "How does machine learning work?", "output": "Machine learning is like teaching a child to recognize animals. Just as you show a child many pictures of cats and dogs, telling them which is which, machine learning shows a computer thousands of examples with the correct answers. Over time, the child learns to identify key features - cats have pointed ears, dogs come in many sizes - and can recognize new animals they've never seen before. Similarly, the computer learns patterns from the training data and can make predictions about new, unseen information. The more examples both the child and computer see, the better they become at making accurate identifications."}
